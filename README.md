## Sentiment Analysis Project using LSTM with FastText and Word2Vec
Welcome to our Sentiment Analysis project repository! In this project, we utilize LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks along with FastText and Word2Vec embeddings to perform sentiment analysis on text data.

## Project Overview
Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the emotional tone behind a piece of text. In this project, we aim to classify text data into different sentiment categories such as positive, negative, or neutral using deep learning techniques.
